This disk image uses the traditional OpenWrt layout, a squashfs read-only root filesystem and a read-write partition where settings and packages you install are stored. Due to how this image is assembled, you will have less than 100MB of space to store additional packages and configuration, and extroot does not work. It supports booting from EFI.

Connect a keyboard and monitor
Make sure an ethernet cable to your upstream modem is connected to the LAN1 port.

Boot the VNOPN and **press F7** to select a boot device. Coose your USB drive:

When the installer launches, use the up arrow (â†‘) to navigate to the **Help** menu in the top right, and select **Enter shell**:

From the terminal prompt, download an Openwrt image. I used [tobiasmcnulty/router-openwrt v22.03.2](https://github.com/tobiasmcnulty/router-openwrt/releases/tag/22.03.2_x86_64) and created a Bitly link for the `openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-squashfs-combined.img.gz` image, to make it easier to type into the terminal. Download and decompress the image:

```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://bit.ly/3UcZ23h -O openwrt-squashfs.img.gz
gunzip openwrt-squashfs.img.gz
```

Identify the internal drive you wish to install Openwrt on (in my case `/dev/sda`):

```sh
lsblk
```

Write the image to the internal drive:

```sh
dd if=openwrt-squashfs.img bs=1M of=/dev/sda
```

Finally reboot:

```sh
reboot
```

Now plug an ethernet cable from your laptop into the LAN 1 port. You should see the link become active:

Connect to the web UI by accessing http://192.168.1.1 in your browser:

![Login screen](login-screen.png)

By default, you can log in without a password.

Navigate to Network->Interfaces to see the default interfaces:

![Openwrt default interfaces](openwrt-default-interfaces.png)

Next we'll queue up a few changes:

* My network will use NAT behind my AT&T router, which uses the 192.168.1.x DHCP range, so I want to use non-conflicting DHCP range, 192.168.2.1. Edit the LAN interface and change the IPv4 address to 192.168.2.1:

    ![Configure LAN address](openwrt-change-lan-address.png)

* I want **LAN 1** to be the **WAN** port connected to my AT&T router, so edit the **WAN interface** and move it to the **eth0 device** (e.g. the LAN1 port):

    ![Configure WAN interface](openwrt-wan.png)

* I want **LAN 2** and **LAN 3** to be my **LAN** network. Switch to the devices tab, click configure on the `br-lan` device, and select the **eth1** and **eth2** bridge ports (LAN 1 and LAN 2, respectively):

    ![Configure br-lan device](openwrt-bridge-device.png)

* Lastly, delete WAN6 interface

Select Apply and Save. Switch your laptop ethernet cable to **LAN 2** and plug your upstream ethernet cable into **LAN 1**.

Now you should be able to access https://192.168.2.1 from your browser. You should also have working Internet! If everything looks good, just plug your network switch into **LAN 2** or **LAN 3**.
